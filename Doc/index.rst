Welcome to PyFrac's documentation!
==================================

PyFrac is a 3D hydraulic fracture simulator for fractures propagating in a plane. Currently, the under development code has the following capabilities:

- Isotropic and transversely isotropic elastic infinite medium
- In-homogeneous and anisotropic fracture toughness
- In-homogeneous leak-off properties
- In-homogeneous in-situ minimum stress
- Buoyant fluid
- Fracture closure and re-opening (multiple injection)
- Time dependent injection history
- Post processing and visualization routines

The code is largely based on Implicit Level Set Algorithm (see details `[here] <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782508000443>`_). The numerical scheme has the following features:

- Level set description of the fracture front atop a Cartesian mesh (rectangular elements).
- Multiscale resolution via the coupling of the semi-infinite hydraulic fracture tip solution with the finite discretization.
- Boundary element discretization for quasi-static elasticity.
- Finite volume discretization for lubrication flow.
- Fully coupled implicit hydro-mechanical solver.
- Eikonal equation solved via fast-marching method for fracture front evolution.
- Adaptive time-stepping.
- Implicit/explicit fracture front advancing.
- Re-meshing.
