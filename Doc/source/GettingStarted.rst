   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Getting started
===============

Running PyFrac will require a functioning installation of Python 3, numpy, SciPy and matplotlib. You can download ANACONDA distribution with all these packages from `[here] <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_. To run PyFrac using Unix shell or windows command prompt, the directory containing the PyFrac source code is required to be added to the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable. It can be added with the following command on windows (give the local path of the ``src`` folder in place of "path_of_PyFrac_src")::

    set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;"path_of_PyFrac_src"

and with the following for linux::

    export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:"path_of_PyFrac_src"

PyFrac uses dill package for saving files on hard disk. You can use pip to install the latest distribution of the package with the following command::

    pip install dill

If you already have python 3 installed, update installed packages to the latest version. You can use the following to update all installed packages::

   conda update --all

Running an example
-------------------

Change directory to the folder containing the PyFrac code. An example can be run from the windows command prompt or linux shell by executing the example script e.g.::

    python ./examples/radial_viscosity_explicit.py

There are scripts available for a set of examples in the examples folders provided with the code, including the scripts to reproduce the results presented in the paper published in Computer Physics Communications. The corresponding example number from the paper is mentioned in the name of these scripts. Note that some of the examples may take upto 2 hours to run.

Documentation
-------------
You can generate the html documentation locally using sphinx. First install shpinx using pip::

   pip install sphinx

Then change directory to the Doc folder present in the PyFrac code. Run make command to build the documentation::

   make html

After the build is complete, you can access the documentation in the build folder. Start with the file named index.
